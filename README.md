# Hey there!
Do you have a LED light strip that came with a cheap remote & doesn't let you program it? Well, I do so I got my hands on an infrared receiver, transmitter and a Raspberry PI Pico and wrote a bit of code to control my light strip. 

## How to test yourself:
This should work for other strips (I think) but you may have to change around your command ID's which you can find from uncommenting the line that has the comment "UNCOMMENT TO SEE CODES". Then upload your code to your pi pico with your favorite upload agent, connect your transmitter to pin 2, and you should be good to go! 

Note: You may need to get realy close to your light's sensor for it to pick up the signals
